# String analyzer

Created as part of a challenge, the original challenge can be found below

```
make a program that will accept a string and:
* output how many characters the string is
* convert all characters to uppercase
* convert all characters to lowercase

YOU CANNOT USE ANY STRING LIBRARIES (std::string, String, etc)
```

The program is written in only x86 assembly for Linux, and is heavily commented for others who want to learn.

To build the string analyzer, simply type `make`, to build for debug you can type `make debug`, and as always `make clean` to clean the workspace.  Requires both `nasm` and `ld` to be installed for building, although they may already be installed, they are rather common build tools.
